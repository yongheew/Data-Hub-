## Introduction
DataHub is an AI-powered operational intelligence platform built using Firebase, Google Cloud, Flutter, Gemini, and Vertex AI. It provides organizations with a centralized system to capture, interpret, and utilize frontline incident reports, enabling faster responses and more informed decision-making. Moving beyond fragmented logs and disconnected reporting methods, DataHub transforms unstructured inputs into actionable insights, helping teams detect recurring issues early, improve workplace safety, and enhance operational efficiency.

## Project Overview:
**Problem Statement** 
Frontline workers such as security guards, maintenance staffs, cleaners, and facility operators are responsible for recording incidents, managing daily operations, and responding to issues across shifts. These are often reported using handwritten logs, WhatsApp messages, spreadsheets, and disconnected systems. 
Though these reports are recorded, they are often unstructured and inconsistent, which leads to lack of coherent operation memory from the organizations. Recurring issues are treated as isolated events, patterns are missed, and preventable failures continue. Supervisors must manually review scattered data, leading to <ins>slow responses, inefficient planning</ins>, and increased safety risks. 
> A traditional database can store data, but it cannot understand meaning, detect semantic similarities or connect records over time. This is where **AI** step into the game.

**SDG Alignment**
This project is highly related to 2 SDGs, which are SDG 8 and SDG 9.
1. ``SDG 8 💼 - Decent Work and Economic Growth``: Enhances workplace efficiency and safety.
2. ``SDG 9 🏗️ - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:`` Improves operational infrasturcture and enables better decision-making through technology.

**Solution**
DataHub transforms unstructured operational inputs into a persistent, intelligence system memory. Instead of acting as a chatbot, it builds <ins>historical understanding across time, locations, and incidents</ins> to help organizations make better decisions based on accumulated data.

It allows workers to log issues easily, while AI structures, links, and analyzes those records to surface patterns and insights.

## Key Features
- 📝 Simple text and optional voice-based incident logging
- 🧠 AI-powered summurization and structuring of frontline reports
- 🔗 Linking of new records to related historical incidents
- 🚨 Recurrence detection for frequently occuring issues
- 📊 Basic dashboard view of incident trends and history

## Technologies Used
**Google Technologies**
1. ``Gemini API:`` for natural language understanding and summarization
2. ``Vertex AI:`` for inident classification and severity estimation (including risk prediction)
3. ``Firebase Authentication:`` for secure user access
4. ``Cloud Firestore:`` for real-time data storage  

**Other Supporting Tools/ Libraries**
1. ``Flutter:`` 
2. ``GitHub:`` for version control and collaboration use
